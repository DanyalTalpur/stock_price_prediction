# This project focuses on predicting stock prices using machine learning techniques and real-time data. It employs various models and algorithms to analyze historical stock data and make predictions based on the latest market trends. The project includes:

# Integration of live data using yfinance library to fetch real-time stock data from popular financial markets.
# Data preprocessing and feature engineering to extract relevant information from stock datasets.
# Implementation of different machine learning models, such as LSTM, CNN, and Random Forest, to capture complex patterns and make accurate predictions.
# Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance and enhance prediction accuracy.
# Evaluation metrics, including RMSE and MAE, to assess the accuracy of the predictions.
# Visualization of results, including graphs and charts, to showcase the model's performance.
